# PORT IN PROGRESS

There are two applications in here. 

## Jifty-based Qublog

You can start the first by installing all the dependencies needed for Jifty and
running:

    bin/jifty server

This works better at the moment.

## Catalyst-based Qublog

This is what I'm porting to for various reasons I won't go into here and now. If
you install the requirements for this (Catalyst, DBIx::Class, etc.) you can run:

    bin/qublog_server_server.pl

This is mostly a pure server-driven application at the moment. The port is
complete, but lacks much of the client-side scripting it should have.
